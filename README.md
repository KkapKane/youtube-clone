- Ability to search for any video or channel. (only displays 10 results due to limited api quota)
- Watch page was built from scratch with automatic scaling
- Mobile friendly
- Displays comments and nested comments (only displays 5 main thread due to limited api quota and up to 10 nested comments)
- Clicking a category in the categories bar will invoke a search request for all videos relevant to that tag

# Things I learned from this Project

* React components can be used within itself
* You don't have to host the frontend and backend on the same server
* Building a responsive site is easier if you start mobile first
* You can use dotenv to hide api keys
* states can be forced to show updated values by using callback function as the 2nd parameter
